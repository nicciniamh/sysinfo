# System Information
The sysinfo program displays cpu, ram and diskusage as well as uptime, loadaverage and cpu temperature on sysfs systems which support it. 

## Background
I wanted an alternative for the *nix df command which would show diskusage using bar graphs. Once this worked I added other system information. 

### Program Arguments
|Argument|Usage|
|--------|-----|
|--system|	true or false to show or hide system information
|--filesystems|true or false to show filesystem usage
|--termwidth|an integer representing terminal width. This prevents using an ioctl to determine the terminal width. Usefull for scripts.
|--watch|Clear screen and refresh every watch-interval seconds. Default is 1 second. Can be a fractional second.
|--watch-interval|Seconds to wait between refresh

### Example Output
This is the output of sysinfo on my Raspberry Pi4
