<h1 class="title">sysinfo(1) | General Commands Manual</h1>
</header>
<h1 id="system-information">System Information</h1>
<p>The sysinfo program displays cpu, ram and diskusage as well as uptime, load average and cpu temperature on sysfs systems which support it. Display may be on a terminal or in a GTK application. CPU percentages are graphed, per core.</p>
<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p>sysinfo has been tested on macOS Catalina and macOS Ventura, Debian Bullseye and Ubuntu Server. GTK may not be available on Macintosh Systems.</p>
<h3 id="program-arguments">Program Arguments</h3>
<pre><code>--gtk               Use GUI
--nofilesystems     Don&#39;t show filesystem usage
--nosystem          Don&#39;t show system information
--notitle           Don&#39;t set a title on the terminal
--nousers           Don&#39;t display logged in users.
--termwidth         An integer representing number of terminal columns
--watch, -w         Clear screen and refresh every watch-interval
--interval, -i      Seconds to wait between refresh &gt;.15 seconds.</code></pre>
<h3 id="terminal-watch-mode">Terminal Watch Mode</h3>
<p>When the option –watch or -w is used, sysinfo clears the screen, and updates the information every interval seconds (set with -i or –interval). Unless –notitle is set, the terminal title is updated showing the program name and hostname. To exit, press Escape, Q or q.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To install perform these actions:</p>
<p><code>cp sysinfo ~/bin # or any folder on your PATH</code></p>
<p>To install the manual page:</p>
<p><code>cp sysinfo.1 /usr/local/man/man1 # Optional, this can be any path on MANPATH</code></p>
<p>For the Desktop files, if running in a linux/unix-like environment that supports Opendesktop standards, suchs as Gnome, Mate, Cinnamon, LXDE, KDE, etc.:</p>
<pre><code>desktop-file-install --dir=~/.local/share/applications sysinfo.desktop
desktop-file-install --dir=~/.local/share/applications sysinfo-gtk.desktop
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications</code></pre>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Since there are a variety of tools that produce similar results, why another one? Initially, I wanted an alternative for the *nix df command which would show diskusage using bar graphs. Once this worked, I looked for other information to add, then added the GTK interface, then the curses code to exit more gracefully from the terminal watch mode.</p>
<h2 id="technicals">Technicals</h2>
<p>sysinfo is written in Python and relies heavily on the psutil module. Originally written for a terminal app, it made sense to add a Gtk interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gtk code should only get executed when the –gtk flag is used. This is to prevent an exception on systems without Gtk.</li>
<li>To calculate the network speeds a thread is created which calculates the difference in total bytes sent/received. This is done every second so we can determine bytes per second.</li>
<li>curses is used in terminal watch mode. This is to allow receiving the terminal quit codes (esc, q or Q) to end the program.</li>
</ul>
