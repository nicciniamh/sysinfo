sysinfo(1)                  General Commands Manual                 sysinfo(1)

       The  sysinfo program displays cpu, ram and diskusage as well as uptime,
       load average and cpu temperature on sysfs  systems  which  support  it.
       Display  may be on a terminal or in a GTK application.  CPU percentages
       are graphed, per core.

       sysinfo has been tested on macOS Catalina  and  macOS  Ventura,  Debian
       Bullseye and Ubuntu Server.  GTK may not be available on Macintosh Sys‐
       tems.

              --gtk               Use GUI
              --nofilesystems     Don't show filesystem usage
              --nosystem          Don't show system information
              --notitle           Don't set a title on the terminal
              --nousers           Don't display logged in users.
              --termwidth         An integer representing number of terminal columns
              --watch, -w         Clear screen and refresh every watch-interval
              --interval, -i      Seconds to wait between refresh >.15 seconds.

       When the option –watch or -w is used, sysinfo clears  the  screen,  and
       updates  the information every interval seconds (set with -i or –inter‐
       val).  Unless –notitle is set, the terminal title  is  updated  showing
       the program name and hostname.  To exit, press Escape, Q or q.

       To install perform these actions:

       cp sysinfo ~/bin # or any folder on your PATH

       To install the manual page:

       cp  sysinfo.1  /usr/local/man/man1  # Optional, this can be any path on
       MANPATH

       For the Desktop files, if running in a linux/unix-like environment that
       supports  Opendesktop  standards, suchs as Gnome, Mate, Cinnamon, LXDE,
       KDE, etc.:

              desktop-file-install --dir=~/.local/share/applications sysinfo.desktop
              desktop-file-install --dir=~/.local/share/applications sysinfo-gtk.desktop
              update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications

       Since there are a variety of tools that produce  similar  results,  why
       another  one?   Initially, I wanted an alternative for the *nix df com‐
       mand which would show diskusage using bar graphs.  Once this worked,  I
       looked for other information to add, then added the GTK interface, then
       the curses code to exit more gracefully from the terminal watch mode.

       sysinfo is written in Python and relies heavily on the  psutil  module.
       Originally  written  for a terminal app, it made sense to add a Gtk in‐
       terface.

       • Gtk code should only get executed when the –gtk flag is  used.   This
         is to prevent an exception on systems without Gtk.

       • To  calculate the network speeds a thread is created which calculates
         the difference in total bytes sent/received.  This is done every sec‐
         ond so we can determine bytes per second.

       • curses  is  used  in terminal watch mode.  This is to allow receiving
         the terminal quit codes (esc, q or Q) to end the program.
