.SH System Information
.PP
The sysinfo program displays cpu, ram and diskusage as well as uptime,
load average and cpu temperature on sysfs systems which support it.
Display may be on a terminal or in a GTK application.
CPU percentages are graphed, per core.
.SS Compatibility
.PP
sysinfo has been tested on macOS Catalina and macOS Ventura, Debian
Bullseye and Ubuntu Server.
GTK may not be available on Macintosh Systems.
.SS Program Arguments
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--gtk               Use GUI
--nofilesystems     Don\[aq]t show filesystem usage
--nosystem          Don\[aq]t show system information
--notitle           Don\[aq]t set a title on the terminal
--nousers           Don\[aq]t display logged in users.
--termwidth         An integer representing number of terminal columns
--watch, -w         Clear screen and refresh every watch-interval
--interval, -i      Seconds to wait between refresh >.15 seconds.
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Terminal Watch Mode
.PP
When the option \[en]watch or -w is used, sysinfo clears the screen, and
updates the information every interval seconds (set with -i or
\[en]interval).
Unless \[en]notitle is set, the terminal title is updated showing the
program name and hostname.
To exit, press Escape, Q or q.
.SS Installation
.PP
To install perform these actions:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cp sysinfo \[ti]/bin
cp sysinfo.1 /usr/local/man/man1 # Optional
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
For the Desktop files:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
desktop-file-install --dir=\[ti]/.local/share/applications sysinfo.desktop
desktop-file-install --dir=\[ti]/.local/share/applications sysinfo-gtk.desktop
update-desktop-database \[ti]/.local/share/applications
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Background
.PP
I wanted an alternative for the *nix df command which would show
diskusage using bar graphs.
Once this worked I added other system information and features
.SS Technicals
.PP
sysinfo is written in Python and relies heavily on the psutil module.
Originally written for a terminal app, it made sense to add a Gtk
interface.
.IP \[bu] 2
Gtk code should only get executed when the \[en]gtk flag is used.
This is to prevent an exception on systems without Gtk.
.IP \[bu] 2
To calculate the network speeds a thread is created which calculates the
difference in total bytes sent/received.
This is done every second so we can determine bytes per second.
.IP \[bu] 2
curses is used in terminal watch mode.
This is to allow receiving the terminal quit codes (esc, q or Q) to end
the program.
